## Page Structure

## Import Structure

### Main Features Index
```javascript
// src/components/features/index.js
export * from './LODashboard';
export * from './LOADashboard';
export * from './PartnershipDashboard';
export * from './pipeline';
```

### Page Exports
```javascript
// src/pages/index.js
export { default as LODashboardPage } from './LODashboardPage';
export { default as LOADashboardPage } from './AdminDashboardPage';

## Benefits of This Structure

2. **Easy Maintenance:** Components are organized by functionality and user role
3. **Scalability:** New features can be easily added to the appropriate dashboard
4. **Professional Organization:** Follows industry best practices for React component organization
5. **Intuitive Navigation:** Developers can quickly find components based on user role
